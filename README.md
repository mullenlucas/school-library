# school-library
> A command-line library app made with Ruby that records and follows transactions of books between the library and its users

## Built with

- **Ruby** Popular programming language that‚Äôs used for lots of things, from web app development to data analysis.
- **Gitflow** Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development
- **Linter checks (rubocop)** Local and Pull Request check for errors, bugs and stylistic errors in code

## Getting started

### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mullenlucas/school-library.git
cd school-library
```

### Check your Ruby version

```shell
ruby --version && irb
```

The ouput should start with something like `ruby 3.1.2`

If not, install the right ruby version using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) (it could take a while):

```shell
rbenv install 3.1.2
```

### Testing

To test and utilize the code, use the terminal and run ruby by inputting `irb` in the command line, or by using an extension in Visual Studio Code like *Code runner*

The user then can modify and play with the files as needed

<!-- ### Install dependencies

Using [Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler) and [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn):

```shell
bundle && yarn
``` -->
